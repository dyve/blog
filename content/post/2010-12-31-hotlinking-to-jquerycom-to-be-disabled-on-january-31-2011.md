<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">Apparently some people are using the jQuery websites instead of the (much faster) CDN's. This has caused problems for these sites.
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Lately, we have noticed a significant increase in traffic from sites that <a href="http://altlab.com/hotlinking.html" title="What is hotlinking?" target="_blank">hotlink</a> directly to files on our various properties (jquery.com, jqueryui.com, dev.jquery.com, etc.) instead of downloading and hosting them locally or taking advantage of the CDNs that we and others (Google, Microsoft, etc.) provide for this purpose. This behavior has started to negatively&nbsp;affect&nbsp;the performance of our network and is preventing legitimate users from accessing our site at peak times.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The jQuery teams has announced that they will disable hotlinking to all CSS, JavaScript and other types of content effective January 31, 2011.&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support them in this. If your site is using sources from jquery.com or jqueryui.com, you should now know that this is wrong and fix this as soon as possible. They even give you the information necessary to fix your site:</p>
