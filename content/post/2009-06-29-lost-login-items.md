<p>After the usual boot ritual (Mac boots, I make coffee) I logged in and I was missing something. Rather, I was missing a lot of little somethings that are supposed to appear in my Menu Bar. A quick peek into my User Settings confirmed my suspicions. All my Login Items were gone. <br />&nbsp;<br />It made me think of my Windows years, where you never knew whether or not your profile would be intact after logging in (especially not an a laptop with a roaming profile that was used in- and outside of a corporate network). <br />&nbsp;<br />Anyway, I decided to just click my way through Time Machine to yesterday afternoon, found <strong>~/Library/Preferences/loginwindow.plist</strong>, restored it, logged out, logged in, and all way right with the world. Don't know why or how it happened, but unless it happens again, I can't be bothered. If stuff can be fixed faster than I can drink my coffee, it's OK with me.</p>
