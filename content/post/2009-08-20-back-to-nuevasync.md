<p>After some comments from <a href="http://twitter.com/jonskeet" target="_blank">Jon Skeet</a> over at <a href="http://superuser.com" target="_blank">SuperUser.com</a> in response to my praise of <a href="http://nuevasync.com" target="_blank">Nuevasync</a>, I tried Google native syncing methods for getting my contacts and calendars from the cloud to my iPhone. It all seemed to work well, until I noticed that certain contacts kept duplicating. After making sure there was no other sync service operational (I have tried a few), I was pretty sure it had to be something between the iPhone and Google.</p>
<p>So, I went back to Nuevasync, and all has been well since. By the way, the Google Calendar Sync was working just fine, but I can only set up one Exchange sync on the iPhone, so that went back to Nuevasync as well.</p>
<p>Update Aug 23 2009: Switching back to Nuevasync didn't make the duplicates go away. I guess it's something else. Will investigate further.</p>
<p>Update: I eventually switched to Google Sync permanently.</p>
