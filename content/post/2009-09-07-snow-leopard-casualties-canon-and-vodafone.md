+++
<p>Last Friday I upgraded my MacBook to Snow Leopard. Very easy, noticeable speed improvement, everything worked except for 2 pieces of hardware (both driver issues). My ancient Canon Lide 35 scanner sort of works, but the hardware buttons on the scanner aren't responding. My Vodafone K3760 3G modem (Vodafone's newest modem) causes kernel panics. <br />&nbsp;<br />Of course it would have been ideal if all companies were properly prepared, but it's not an ideal world. However, note the difference in Canon's and Vodafone's response to the Snow Leopard issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canon has announces Snow Leopard compatible drivers for the Lide 35 "in a few days" (I'm confident they will, they were also quick to resolve Leopard issues after the Tiger-Leopard upgrade, and Lide 35 was already out of production at the time).</li>
<li> Vodafone says "it will probably be October" before the K3760 is working properly under Snow Leopard.</li>
</ul>
