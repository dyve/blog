<p>If you are an early adopter of <a href="http://www.gmail.com" target="_blank">Gmail</a>, you may have defined a label named Unread. In the early days of Gmail, this was possible. Google later made it impossible to create this label. However, those of us who already had it kept it.</p>

<p>A few months ago, label:unread lost much of its use since the search view wasn't updated as dynamically as before. Often when clicking on my Unread label, I got the wrong result (messages that had recently been marked as read, missing newly received unread messages).</p>
<p>Today I decided to try label:unread with Priority Inbox. I created a section that displays label:unread. Lo and behold, it dynamically updates to show me all unread messages anywhere (except for Trash and Spam). It works like a charm.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Settings, Priority Inbox</li>
<li>Select a Priority Inbox section that is not in use (or one you're willing to replace). I picked the third section.</li>
<li>Click Create section (or if you are replacing, Options), More options ...</li>
<li>Select All from label, then select label Unread</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;If you have a label:unread lurking somewhere, I recommend you try this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Having an instant view of all unread mail is so useful, I recommend Google somehow makes this possible for all Gmail users.</p>
