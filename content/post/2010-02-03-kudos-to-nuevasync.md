<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.nuevasync.com/" target="_blank">Nuevasync</a>. They made contacts and calendar syncing between my Google Account and my iPhone possible when Google couldn't work out how to get it right. After a while, Google caught up, and recently I've been happy with the native Google offerings. That means&nbsp;I've been using Google Sync exclusively for a few months now, and haven't had a reason to go back to Nuevasync as a middle man.</p>
<p>This makes me feel a little sad, because they really have great products. Still, they seem to have found their niche, their business model and their customers, and they are still going strong. Here's to Nuevasync, don't hesitate to check them out for your syncing needs!</p>
