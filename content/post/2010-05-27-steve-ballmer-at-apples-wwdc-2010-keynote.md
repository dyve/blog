<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/26/microsofts-steve-ballmer-to-present-during-wwdc-2010-keynote/">MacRumors.com</a> suggests Microsoft's Steve Ballmer may take the stage during Steve Jobs' WWDC 2010 keynote:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Microsoft will reportedly be talking about their development tool Visual Studio 2010.  The new version of Visual Studio will reportedly allow developers to write native applications for the iPhone, iPad and Mac OS.</blockquote>
<p>I would be pretty impressed with both Apple and Microsoft if this turned out to be true. Having Visual Studio as a dev platform on Windows will lure even more developers to the iTunes App Store, which is good for those developers and for Apple.</p>
