<p>I noticed <a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> just when I was getting into <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> and <a href="http://script.aculo.us">script.aculo.us</a>. It looked both interesting and weird to me, but since I was working on a project that I really wanted to finish before getting my attention drawn elsewhere, I decided to stick it out with the aforementioned libraries.</p>
<p>A bit later, the jQuery buzz grew louder, and I had a spare time project that required some JavaScript, with a little AJAX. I decided to go for jQuery because of its small size and lack of bloat. Once I got into it, I never looked back. jQuery code is both brief and beautiful (remember, less code is better), its perfectly possible to write readable JavaScript, the DOM is your slave, and the basic things that JavaScript seems to lack (a least in some browsers) are there.</p>
<p>My jQuery plugins are here: <a href="http://dyve.net/jquery" target="_blank">http://dyve.net/jquery</a></p>
