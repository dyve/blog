<p>Recently I noticed I wasn't getting my TV show torrents from ShowRSS&nbsp;anymore. A little investigation revealed that they were not serving&nbsp;720p episodes when they became available. <p /> Googling for a better solution led me to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I now use <a href="http://www.dailytvtorrents.org/">http://www.dailytvtorrents.org/</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>I take their feed for all shows, with a preference for 720p&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.dailytvtorrents.org/rss/allshows?prefer=720&amp;wait=4">http://www.dailytvtorrents.org/rss/allshows?prefer=720&amp;wait=4</a>)&nbsp;</li>
<li>I have a filter in uTorrent that selects the episodes to download&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Works like a charm, and I'm getting all my shows again.</p>
