The [Identification Atlas of Birds of Aragon](http://blascozumeta.com/species-files/ "Identification Atlas of Birds of Aragon") is an amazing collection of PDF's (of up to 6MB in size) of various birds that can be found in Aragon, Spain. Very useful for birders that visit Europe. Great pictures of specific differences between species.

Thank you, [Javier Blasco](http://blascozumeta.com/contact/ "Javier Blasco")!
