<p><a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie for Mac is</a> is my favorite Twitter client on the Mac. I paid for the full version (with a little help from Macheist), and I use it every day.</p>
<p>On April 9, 2010, Tweetie's author and owner Loren Brichter announced that Twitter had <a>acquired his company</a> and that new versions of the iPhone App would be free. I paid $2.99 for Tweetie 2 for iPhone and love it, and I am happy for everyone that will get this excellent app for free. Even better, <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/04/twitter-for-iphone.html">an iPad version is in the works</a>!</p>
<p>Neither Loren Brichter / atebits nor Ev / Twitter has said anything about the future of Tweetie for Mac. <a href="http://twitter.com/dyve/status/13292778444">My question on twitter was not answered</a>. Maybe I missed something, if so, please let me know. Let's hope Twitter don't discontinue Tweetie for Mac, because it's a lovely little program (with a version 2 in the works, <a href="http://news.atebits.com/post/199400544/bigbird-redux">as announced before the acquisition</a>).</p>
<p>Also, thank you Loren for these excellent apps, let's hope the move to Twitter brings even more greatness.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp;Looks like Loren has reported Tweetie for Mac as alive and kicking: <a href="http://www.twittwittwitter.com/tweetie-2-for-mac-coming-soon/">http://www.twittwittwitter.com/tweetie-2-for-mac-coming-soon/</a> =&gt; <a href="http://www.macheist.com/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=370710#p370710">http://www.macheist.com/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=370710#p370710</a></p>
