<p>Over at the <a href="http://blog.runkeeper.com/running-app/runkeeper-pro-free">RunKeeper blog</a>, CEO Jason Jacobs has an interesting announcement:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>As the end of January approaches, we have been blown away by the response to RunKeeper Pro being free.&nbsp;Based on what we have learned in the last month, and based on our long-term goal of building the biggest most engaged community of users that we can (who get the best fitness results in the process), it became clear what we needed to do. We are pleased to announce that, as of today, RunKeeper Pro will continue to be a FREE download!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So one of the top grossing apps of 2010 (according to Jacobs) thinks free is the way to go. Interesting times!</p>
<p>RunKeeper is an excellent application. I can't wait to use it again (which won't be any time soon due to an ankle injury, alas).&nbsp;The Pro version being free for everybody makes it much more likely I'll be running into RunKeeper users online or offline. I saw on Twitter one of my teammates is already a RunKeeper.</p>
