<p>Dear <a href="http://posterous.com">Posterous</a>,</p>
<p>I am writing to you from the past, and I don't even need your awesome "<a href="http://blog.posterous.com/new-feature-schedule-your-posts-for-the-futur">Schedule this post for the future</a>" feature to do so.&nbsp;In fact, I don't need to use any feature at all, I just post something using the bookmarklet or the web interface, and you date my post 9 hours into the past.</p>
<p>It would be great if you could do something to improve Posterous' sensitivity to time zones. Or tell me what I'm doing wrong.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>An otherwise happy user (May 10, 6:29 AM, Europe/Amsterdam)</p>
<p>Update September 29, 2010: Look, the time is correct!</p>
