<p>Can someone point me to a solution that does this:</p>
<ul>
<li>connect multiple sources of contacts&nbsp;</li>
<li>automatically merge identical contacts&nbsp;</li>
<li>alert me of possible conflicts&nbsp;</li>
<li>provide an API so I can sync my iPhone, Address Book etc with it&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We've got this stuff for e-mail, it should be available for contacts. <p /> If this is too much to ask, then maybe Google has a solution to sync/merge the contacts I have on 2 Google Apps accounts and my private Gmail account?</p>
