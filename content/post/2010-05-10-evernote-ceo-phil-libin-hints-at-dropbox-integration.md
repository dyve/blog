<h4>I use Evernote for many things but for certain projects and files I use another great application: Dropbox. Will we see an Evernote with virtual disc capacity to store and synchronize files?</h4>
<p>I love Dropbox and use them all the time. We’re quite friendly with them and hope to do an integration soon. I think an Evernote / Dropbox solution would be pretty great!</p>
