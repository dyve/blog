<p>This post is about the identity of Red John in the TV series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mentalist">The Mentalist</a>. If you haven't seen the final episode of Season 2, there are spoilers ahead.</p>
<p><!--more-->My theory is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_John">Red John</a> is Brett Partridge (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0687443/">Jake Plotnick</a>), the forensics guy that has shown up on both Red John copycat killings the series has featured. The first was in the pilot episode (S01E01, "Pilot"), the second was in the season 2 finale (S02E23, "Red Sky in the Morning"). There's more people that have noticed the clues below, I don't claim credit for all of them (but I did hunt down the pilot script to make sure Partridge was in that).</p>
<p>Pro</p>
<ul>
<li>Brett Partridge shows up every time a Red John copycat is active.</li>
<li>The producers took care to bring back the actor who originally played Partridge.</li>
<li>Partridge's forensics job would give him access to law enforcement databases (much like Dexter Morgan in Dexter).</li>
<li>Even in early versions of the pilot script, Brett Partridge is accurately described (odd, for someone with a very small speaking part).</li>
<li>The first line Partridge speaks in the series is&nbsp;"<strong>Red John enters here</strong>" (S01E01).</li>
<li>I found the script <a href="http://www.thementalisttvshow.com/thread/2846393/Original+Character+names!!">through a link here</a>, and copied it to this page to preserve it (see below).</li>
<li>The poem Red John quotes to Patrick Jane in S02E23 is William Blake's "The Tiger". It has been quoted so often it's almost boring, and therefore seems like a strange choice. "The Tiger" can be explained to describe that what we fear is part of the world in which we live as much as that what gives us peace, the tiger as much as the lamb.</li>
<li>One of William Blake's signature oil pantings is titled "A brace of Partridge" and shows two dead partridges, subtly linking the poem to Partridge.</li>
<li>There is a good voice comparison on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rjXOkCxUUw">YouTube</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, Jane doesn't mention the poem nor the "Roll tide" quote to Lisbon. His smile suggests some form of happiness, which can only be explained by him having made progress on the Red John case. The clues above would have been figured out by Patrick Jane also, which would have him enter Season 3 hunting Brett Partridge. We'll know for sure in a few months ...<br /><div class='p_embed p_file_embed'>

</ul>
<p>Con</p>
<ul>
<li>Partridge looks a little young to be Red John.</li>
<li>There is a mortician with a skull in from the pilot. The tattoo is also very explicitly referenced in the script linked above. He is as of yet unexplained, but seems to important to be a nobody.</li>
