<p>Canon makes good on its promise to deliver Snow Leopard compatible drivers for its older hardware. I just installed the newest drivers for my aging Canon Canoscan Lide 35 flatbed scanner. Even though I got some kind of warning during installation, and I didn't delete the previous driver (the DelDrv driver uninstaller requires Rosetta, and I'm trying to keep that of my system), it's all working just fine. Including the hardware buttons on the scanner.</p>
<p>Well done Canon!</p>
