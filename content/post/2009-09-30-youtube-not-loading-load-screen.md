<p>On Mac OS X Snow Leopard, issues with Google Gears prevent YouTube from loading the Load Screen. This means you cannot upload videos.</p>
<p>To work around, move <code>/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Gears.plugin</code> to the <code>Disabled Plug-Ins</code> folder. Single file upload will work again.</p>
