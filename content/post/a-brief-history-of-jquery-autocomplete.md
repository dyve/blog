Early 2005, I wrote what appears to be the first ever jQuery autocompleter. Several people used it, modified it, fixed bugs, made it better.  Notably <a href="http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/autocomplete.htm">Dan G.  Switzer</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/bassistance" target="_blank">J&ouml;rn Zaffaerer</a> (who I met last year and is a very nice guy) did a <a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-autocomplete/">complete  rewrite</a>, which depends on other jQuery plugins, and has a lot of  added functionality. When I needed some modifications, I took <a href="http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/autocomplete.htm">Dan's  version</a> of my original and did some slight modifications of my own.

Then a lot of stuff happened, a lot of other autocompleters sppeared, jQuery UI (which is awesome) happened, and J&ouml;rn is still adding cool stuff to his version. Why so many different autocompleters? I don't know, apparently there  are a lot of people with different needs (no dependency on other  plugins, browser compatibility), and the various versions have their  minute differences. Just be glad that jQuery offers such a choice, and  pick the one you like best. Me, I'm just proud to be a part of this thing that somehow ended up at various weird locations (Mozilla, Barack Obama's site during the election, and I think some of the code may have made it to the current whitehouse.gov, but I'm not sure).

A while back, I though my original project needed some work, and I cleaned up the code. I also gave this version a proper (versioned) home at Google Code. You can find it at:

Be sure to see if you really want this version. The official jQuery plugin can be found at <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete">http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete</a>.
