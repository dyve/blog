<p>I've been using a Pocket PC and Microsoft Outlook for close to 6 years. This means that my current Outlook calendar holds precious data that I would like to move to my MacBook Pro. Since I'd already been fiddling with Google Calendar, I didn't really research this one. The only thing I looked for was a way to move from Google Calendar to iCal, and I found that. This is how I got all my Outlook calendar data into iCal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new calendar named "Outlook Export" in iCal.</li>
<li>Create a new calendar named "Outlook Export" in Google Calendar.</li>
<li>Exported Outlook calendar to CSV.</li>
<li>Import the CSV file into Google Calendar's "Outlook Export". This may take a while.</li>
<li>Installed the fully functional <a href="http://spanningsync.com/">Spanning Sync</a> trial on the Mac.</li>
<li>Set Spanning Sync to sync your Google Calendar's "Outlook Export" with your iCals "Outlook Export".</li>
<li>Wait, confirm your choice when your Mac asks for it, wait some more.</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ul>
