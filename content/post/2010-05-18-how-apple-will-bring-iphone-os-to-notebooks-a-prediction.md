<p>Over at <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/">TUAW</a>, <a href="http://ericasadun.com/">Erica Sadun</a> has posted <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/05/17/could-a-closed-mac-be-in-apples-future/">an entry pondering whether or not Apple will bring its iPhone OS to Macs</a>. They will, even though Steve Jobs has said there will be no App Store for Macs, as someone politely remarked in the comments.</p>
<p>How?<br />They will revive the iBook brand.<br />Within 2 years, Apple will launch a new series of iBooks that will run iPhone OS, with the App Store to match it. Probably something in the netbook-to-13-inch range, my pick would be a 12" screen.</p>
<p>Think about it. It would be a perfect addition to iPod, iPhone and iPad. The iBooks will be just as closed as the other iDevices, and run approved apps from the App Store only.</p>
<p>The new iBooks may or may not have touch screens at launch, but at some point they probably will. These iBooks will provide the ultimate "it just works" experience on a notebook, and iPhone and iPad will have prepped the world for this.</p>
<p>Also, since the new iBooks won't technically be Macs, Steve's promise not to open a Mac App Store won't be broken. Although I could definitely see MacBooks gain the ability to run iBook App Store programs.</p>
<p>Apple has a winner with the iPhone OS, they cannot afford to take it to the MacBook brand (yet) because that would hurt their "traditional" Mac OS X. They have an appropriately named and well-known notebook trademark gathering dust on the shelves. Surely there must be a prototype iBook  with iPhone OS just waiting to be left at a beer garden somewhere ....</p>
<p>P.S. I'd be interested in a nice mockup picture of an iPhone OS iBook to illustrate this post. Any creatives that want to share?</p>
