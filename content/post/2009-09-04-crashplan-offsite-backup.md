<p>Because <a href="http://www.jungledisk.com">JungleDisk</a> refused to play nice with my mobile internetconnection (causing my system to bog down), I started looking for an alternative offsite backup solution. I ended up using <a href="http://www.crashplan.com" target="_blank">CrashPlan</a>. My MacBook now backs up to a home server at my sister's house. CrashPlan has been running on my laptop for over 2 months now, and it's been a smooth ride. No interference when on low bandwidth connecion, and a small footprint altogether. From my family members I hear that CrashPlan works just fine on Windows XP and Vista too.</p>
<p>Highly recommended, if you're not backing up to an offsite location yet (think of all those documents and pictures), be sure to have a look at CrashPlan. If you don't have a remote server to back up to, or if you'd rather store your backup at a data center, CrashPlan offers paid plans for offsite backups to their servers.</p>
