<p>I don't burn DVD's often, but it's one of those things that I think should just work. It's easy on a Mac. Select files, right click, "Burn X items to disk".</p>
<p>Alas, I was greeted by the dreaded message "Failure to calibare laser power ..." (the Dutch version of it). Some frustration and Google research later, it seemed that this error message meant nothing other than "Your DVD lens is dirty".</p>
<p>A great solution is hidden on this page: <a href="http://muzso.hu/2008/08/17/how-to-clean-the-lens-of-a-slot-loading-optical-drive-a-macbook-pros-superdrive">http://muzso.hu/2008/08/17/how-to-clean-the-lens-of-a-slot-loading-optical-dr...</a></p>
<p>To mae it a little easier to find, I'll reproduce it here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn computer off (just to be safe)</li>
<li>Find a credit card (told you it was a card trick)</li>
<li>Wrap an iPhone cleaning cloth around it. If you don't have an iPhone cleaning cloth, go buy an iPhone, they come with those. Or, use a very thin cleaning cloth for glasses or binoculars.</li>
<li>Insert credit card with cleaning cloth wrapped around it on the left side of the slot loader. Just a few centimeters.</li>
<li>Wiggle back and forth, not up and down.</li>
<li>Done, start computer and burn disk.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this, my MacBook Pro (late 2007) was burning DVD's again, without any errors.</p>
