<p>The machine I work on every day is a mid 2007 15" MacBook Pro and I love it. It can handle the beautiful 30" Cinema Display which I use in my home office, and the screen is big enough to work on when I'm traveling or between meetings. Lately though the measly 160GB disk was filling up fast, mostly because I've taken to shooting RAW images on my Canon. I started looking for a new MacBook, but the newest models do not offer much more than flat keyboard, unibody design and bigger disks. So, I thought I'd better wait for a truly groundbreaking new MacBook and keep working on my current machine for a while.</p>
<p>After some consideration and a little Googling I ordered a Seagate Momentus 7200.4 500GB disk (the ASG version for what it's worth). A local Mac center installed it for me this afternoon&nbsp;(of course I was paranoid enough to make multiple backups before having the new disk installed).</p>
<p>Apart from the very satisfying amount of free space, I'm happy to announce that there is a noticeable speed improvement all around. The old 5400RPM 160GB disk is sitting in a USB enclosure, and of course the magic of Migration Assistent made copying my files to the new disk a breeze. One of those moments when everything just works indeed. This is my first Mac, so I'm still a little amazed by that sometimes.</p>
