<p>You can see what I listen to on my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/dyve">Last.fm profile</a>. The app that brings my music to Last.fm is <a href="http://www.scrobblepod.com/">ScrobblePod</a>. It has some <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/ScrobblePod/forum/100556/_/544263">Snow Leopard issues</a> at the moment, but since it's open source someone just made his own Snow Leopard compatible ScrobblePod builld.</p>
