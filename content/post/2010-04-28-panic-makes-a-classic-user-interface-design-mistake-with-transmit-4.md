<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<p>Transmit is my favourite FTP client and more. I gladly pay for it. The upgrade from Transmit 3 to Transmit 4 was a no-brainer for me. Until I started Transmit 4, and found out that the guys at Panic have made a classic User Interface Design mistake.</p>
<p>"Eye Candy Overdose", also known as "It's less useful but it's prettier". Everything shrinks, slides and pops, but it doesn't always serve a purpose.</p>
<p>What's worse, the "Favorites" section (direct links to often used folders on a local or remote site) is hidden behind a click and a pop-out. Which means that I have to click my Favorites into view every time I need them. The point of favorites being that you need them all the time.</p>
<p>I have complete faith that this mistake will be fixed within a week or so, and that Panic will write a nice blog post to apologize to its user base and admit that this was a big oops. Or they tell me that I somehow missed the setting to show Favorites like in Transmit 3. Let's check the Support section of their website just to make sure ...</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">
<h3>Where did the sidebar and/or preview go?</h3>
<p>The <strong>Sidebar</strong> has been replaced with the new <strong>Places</strong> pop-up. It's the folder with the star &mdash; just click it to get a Dock-like menu of favorite folders, which you can add on a per-server basis. The <strong>Preview drawer</strong> has been replaced with <strong>Quick Look</strong> (and, if you're on Mac OS X 10.6, will still show you image dimensions.)</p>
