<p>My MacBook has passed away for the second time, a vicim of bad Nvidea chips it seems. Repairs will be complete (a new logic board, without faulty chips) in a week or so.</p>
<p>PS: For the record, Apple fixed this without any charge (even though my warranty had expired), and after the logic board upgrade the system has been working like a charm.</p>
