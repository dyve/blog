<p>The two small extensions to the Google Maps Javascript API I posted on this blog are now committed to a Google Code project (Mercurial repository).</p>
<p>Check it out:Â http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-extensions/</p>
<p>I picked the Apache 2.0 License because that's what's used for other Google utilities. Enjoy. Feedback welcome.</p>
