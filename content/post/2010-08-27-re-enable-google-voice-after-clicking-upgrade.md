<p>If you are outside the United States, you can get access to Google Phone by setting your Gmail language to English (US). It's a simple as that. A&nbsp;"Call Phone" options appears in your chat list, and when you click that you get this interface:<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</div>

<p>It really works, you get $0.10 starting credit, and you can buy extra&nbsp;credit using Google Checkout. Buying credit is done by clicking on the down arrow to the right of your credit.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p>This will take you to a Google Voice account. But be careful! Google Voice is still closed to users form outside the USA. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Do not click the button labeled "Upgrade your account"</strong></span>.</p>

<p>If you do, you will get the message that Google Voice is not yet available in your country, and you'll no longer be able to buy credit for Google Phone.</p>

If you did click the button, you can re-enable Google Voice and credit buying by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing <a href="http://hotspotshield.com/" target="_blank">Hotspot Shield</a></li>
<li>Activating Hotspot Shield</li>
<li>Visiting your Google Voice page (through Gmail or direct), and canceling your upgrade</li>
<li>You can then deactivate Hotspot Shield and resume normal use of Gmail and Google Voice</li>
</ul>
<p>This works because Hotspot Shield has the side effect of making Google (and others) think you are US based.</p>
