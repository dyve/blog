<p>When Snow Leopard first came out, it <a href="http://dyve.posterous.com/vodafone-k3760-usb-modem-on-mac-os-x-106-snow" target="_blank">caught Vodafone by surprise</a>. I'm happy to say that <a href="http://www.business.vodafone.com/site/bus/public/enuk/support/10_productsupport/laptop_connectivity/40_software/software/10_latest/p_mac.jsp" target="_blank">the latest version of Vodafone Mobile Connect</a> (v3.04.11.00 at the time of writing) seems to work fine out of the box for the K3760 USB modem on Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Just thought I'd mention it.</p>
