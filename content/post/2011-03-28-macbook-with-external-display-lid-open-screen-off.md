<div>[update: this trick only works for OS X before Lion]</div>
<p />
<div>I've been trying to use my MacBook Air in clamshell mode (internal display powered off) with the lid open (so I can access the keyboard). After seeing various sites describe how to do this, I kept failing. Until I found the&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3131">official resource at support.apple.com</a>. It turns out <strong>having your MacBook plugged into a wall socket</strong> is required to perform this trick. Unbelievable, but true!</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Instructions to use your MacBook with an external display, the lid open and the internal display turned off:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the computer is plugged in to an outlet using the AC power adapter.</li>
<li>Connect a USB mouse to your computer.</li>
<li>With the computer turned on connect the Apple portable (using the appropriate Apple adapter if necessary) to the appropriate port on the external display or projector and turn the display or projector on.</li>
<li>Once your computer's Desktop appears on the external display, close the computer's lid.</li>
<li>Once the lid is closed, wake the computer up by clicking your mouse button.</li>
<li>You are now in clamshell mode.</li>
<li>Open the lid, the display will remain turned off, and only the internal display active.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it!&nbsp;Some sites note that you should enable mirror mode in your display settings at step 3 but I did not need that to get this to work.</p>
