+++
I'm considering buying the new MacBook Air (13 inch screen, 2.16GHz <br />Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM, 256GB flash storage) as my new primary machine. <br />I'll use it for web development (PHP, Python) hooked up to a 30 inch <br />Cinema Display. Apple has confirmed it can drive the 30 inch. <p /> Pro: <br />- no moving parts (apart from the hinges ...) <br />- fast disk <br />- extremely portable <p /> Con: <br />- no user replaceable battery (I'll probably wear it out within 2 years) <br />- no gigabit network <p /> I think I can live with the cons, but I'd be happy to hear from anyone <br />that has prior experience with the Air as a developer's machine. <p /> The machine it would replace is a late 2007 15 inch MacBook Pro.
