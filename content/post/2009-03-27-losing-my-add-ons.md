<p>After a reinstall of Firefox I lost all my add-ons. This gave me a noticeable speed improvement, so I decided to reinstall only those add-ons I really couldn't live without. Part of my strategy was to replace add-ons with bookmarklets whenever possible.  I'm back to 5 add-ons now:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615" target="_blank">Delicious Bookmarks</a><br /> Real integration with a browser feature. Bookmarklets work, but not as beautifully as this add-on.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3414" target="_blank">Dictionary Switcher</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3291" target="_blank">Dutch Dictionary (Woordenboek Nederlands)</a><br /> It switches the spelling checker between various languages. I write both Dutch and English texts daily, so these are a big help. Actually I houldn't count the dictionary as an add-on, but Firefox does.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getfirebug.com" target="_blank">Firebug</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.getfirebug.com" target="_blank">Web Developer<br /> </a>I'm a web developer, I just need these.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 2 bookmarklets I use are "Post to Evernote" and "Share on Posterous". Don't find myself missing much, and I've seriously lost some add-on weight with this setup.</p>
