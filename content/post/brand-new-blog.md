After the demise of [Posterous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous) in 2013, I moved my blog to [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) and mostly forgot about it. I didn't feel like investing time and energy in yet another platform that could be acquired and shut down. Also, Tumblr never felt right for what I wanted to do.
   
The past few years I have been playing with static site generators like [Nikola](https://getnikola.com). I liked their ideas and simplicity. A while ago I found the best static site generator I'd ever seen. It is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and it makes generating simple personal and corporate sites a breeze.

So, here we are. I have moved all the content from my old blog to drafts in the new blog. Posts that are still interesting will be updated and republished. [The first one is already up]({{< relref "post/django-custom-user-model-admin.md" >}}). The Tumblr blog will be deleted. Out with the old, in with the new.

This blog is now powered by Hugo, [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and hosted at [TransIP](https://www.transip.nl). The theme I started with is a slightly modified  [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/1138-4EB/beautifulhugo). I'm planning a how-to article explaning how to connect Hugo, GitHub and Travis, since I had a few minor hiccups until it worked the way I wanted it to work.
