The <a href="http://dyve.posterous.com/scosche-idr650m">Scosche IDR650M</a> in-ear headphones work perfectly with iPhone 4, including remote volume control. Since they were primarily marked for iPod use, with a &quot;works with iPhone&quot; mention on the packaging, I was a little nervous whether or not they&#39;d function properly. After testing earlier today, I can confirm they do.
