<p>Today I noticed that changes I made to my iPhone Calendar did not show up in the connected Google Calendar. After some research, it turned out that my default iPhone calendar was set to a read only calendar I also subscribe too. So, apparently my calendar settings had changed after I upgraded to 3.0. I don't know if this was the 3.0 update or the fact that I tinkered with some settings.</p>
<p>After settings my default calendar on the iPhone to my primary Google Calendar, everything was working again and updates showed online and in iCal.</p>
<p>Your iPhone default calendar can be found in Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendar &gt; (scroll all the way down) Default calendar.</p>
