<p>This one was easy as pie. I wanted to convert all my Outlook contacts to vCards, so that I could import them into Address Book, but also to back them up in a non-proprietary format. Outlook doesn't seem to have a menu option to batch convert contacts to vCards, but it is possible to tell Outlook to do just that. I've used vCard as the standard format for exchanging contacts for a few years, so I already knew this trick for multiple contacts, and it works perfectly for all of them at once too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your Outlook contacts, and select them all (select one, press Ctrl-A).</li>
<li>Click Actions -&gt; Forward as vCard.</li>
<li>Depending on how many contacts you have, Outlook might be busy for a while. Eventually, you'll end up with a new e-mail message with all your precious contacts included as vCards.</li>
<li>In the menu of the e-mail message, click File -&gt; Save attachments. Select a folder, and save.</li>
<li>Congratulations, you've just saved all your Outlook contacts as vCards, using only Outlook. You can discard the message, or send it to an e-mail account as a backup (I mailed mine to my Gmail account).</li>
</ul>
