      <blockquote><div>
                <p>For most of my document writing I use iWork Pages (from iWork '09), and it's usually fine for me. I don't miss Microsoft Word, except for one simple feature: the ability to number chapter titles and paragraph headers for easy reference in the contents of the document and for cross references.</p>

<p>Somehow, I cannot find this feature in Pages '09. It is possible to number headers by setting the style to numbered, but it doesn't mitigate well into the generated dynamic contents, and paragraphs don't follow the numbering of higher level elements it seems.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to make this work?</p>

    <p>I asked this question on SuperUser.com a while ago. Is there still no better way to do this? The accepted answer kind of works but messes with numbered lists in the content way too frequently to be useful.</p></div>
