<p>Sooner or later iTunes is bound to support tagging. I don't mean the (dead) concept of marking a song you hear on the radio for reviewing in the iTunes Store, but the web style method of tagging, such as seen on blogs and del.icio.us.</p>
<p>Still not clear? Suppose you have a track that is a live version of a song you really like. Let's say its genre is Trip-Hop. You want to know this is a live version, so you can select or ignore it in playlists, but how? Also, what if this song is a bonus track (which I often do not want to sync to my iPhone) or a cover version (which I like to group, because I like to hear other people's renditions of songs I really like). The answer is tagging.</p>
<p>My simple solution i to use iTunes <em>Comments</em> section for tagging. I write every tag in there like this: =tag (where tag is the tagname. The comments section of the example above could be:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">=live =cover =bonus</blockquote>
<p>By adding the = sign, you can easily search for tags in smart playlists. Also, you can use the Comments section like you normally would, it won't interfere with ttags. For instance, I could also add some textual comment like this:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Excellent live version of Creep (Radiohead) by Prince. =live =cover</blockquote>
<p>Tag your music like this and your smart playlists will love you!</p>
