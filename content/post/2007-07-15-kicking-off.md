<p>August 1 I will be switching jobs. This will mean that I am once more (among other things) a professional programmer. This time around the tools of the trade will be PHP, MySQL and JavaScript (with more than a touch of <a href="http://www.jquery.com/">jQuery</a>). Also, I'll be switching from Windows to Mac OS X (actually, I'm typing this entry on my brand new MacBook Pro).</p>
<p>I thought this would be a good time to convert this site to a live blog once more. I'll document some Windows to Mac switching issues, share some startup stories (we're starting a new company, and I'm sure some tales will be worth telling). And, most importantly, I'll share some code, jQuery or otherwise.  I hope I can keep you amused for a while.</p>
