+++
<p>The new version of <a href="http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/" target="_blank">Typinator</a> fixes the <a href="http://dyve.posterous.com/typinator-and-unwanted-spaces-in-google-chrom">Google Chrome spaces problem</a> I mentioned earlier this year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hack that I applied back then to get proper snippet expansion in Google Chrome now backfires and causes newlines to go invisible. If you are experiencing this, you know what I'm talking about. To remove the hack, just delete the file Chrome.plist located in <code>~/Library/Application Support/Typinator/Application Settings</code>, then quit and relaunch Typinator.</p>
