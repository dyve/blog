<p>It's July 5, 2010, about 7am. I just made two small posts to <a href="http://dyve.posterous.com">my blog</a> concerning Time Machine backups (just references to two useful tools I found, using the Posterous bookmarklet). Those posts were ridiculously easy to do.</p>
<div>However, they were also wrong.</div>
<p />
<div>Posterous still can't handle the fact that I am in a different time zone. As I said, it's July 5, 2010 here. My posts were gives the timestamp "July 04, 2010 at 10:03 PM".</div>
<p />
<div>How can such a great service have the time to write dozens of importers for big time blogs, and not even support the ubiquitous thing that is time zones? It's beyond me. If it weren't for the fact that they are both awesome and free, I'd say nasty things about them. Now all I do is write a blog post, hope the timestamp comes out OK, and hope that they fix this some day.</div>
