<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Buzz" target="_blank">Can you feel my love buzz</a>? Probably not, because I just switched off <a href="http://buzz.google.com" target="_blank">Google Buzz</a> in <a href="http://mail.google.com" target="_blank">Gmail</a>.</p>
<p>Buzz was constantly trying to grab my attention when I wanted to focus on e-mails, and stole conversations away from the people that were contributing. If I respond to Twitter, you put my response on Twitter (take a hint from <a href="http://www.posterous.com" target="_blank">Posterous</a> comments), else I don't like you.</p>
<p>I really wanted to like Buzz, because overall Google has made my web a better place. I couldn't imagine e-mail without Gmail. Google Apps and Google Docs I use daily (although not exclusively, and Docs is not my primary office suite). Reader is my portal to RSS. With the limited response to Wave (I rarely open it) and now the disappointment with Buzz, I hope they up their game and start making awesome stuff again.</p>
