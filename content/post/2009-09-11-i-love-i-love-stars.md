<p>To get the most out of my music collection, I am fanatic about rating music. The star ratings of the songs, combined with a few playlists power my iPhone syncing and my "personal radio stations". One of the great tools to make rating your songs a breeze is a free little gem of an app called <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/blog/2008/05/15/i-love-stars">I Love Stars</a>. This application is so tiny, it lives in a blog post!</p>
<p>What it does is nothing, until you play a song in iTunes. Then it shows itself as an editable star rating in your menu bar, making it easy to rate the currently playing song. I Love Stars can even alert you to unrated songs.</p>
<p>Please note that if you are running Snow Leopard and/or iTunes 9, you need to upgrade to the latest version of I Love Stars. Earlier versions have a small problem with the new "sudden termination" feature of Snow Leopard, causing iTunes to restart instantly after you quit it.</p>
<p>Kudos to Andy Kim (<a href="http://twitter.com/andypotion">@andypotion</a>) for making this application available to us all!</p>
