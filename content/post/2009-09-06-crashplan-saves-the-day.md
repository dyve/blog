<p>Last Friday I posted about my <a href="http://dyve.posterous.com/crashplan-offsite-backup">switch to CrashPlan</a>. That same evening, when I arrived at my parents' house I was shown a completely dead Dell laptop. That laptop contained all their pictures, music my mother uses for classes she teaches, and my dad's work documents, and it was protected by CrashPlan. The files from their backup were succesfully restored to my dad's desktop later that evening (thanks to my brother-in-law who did all the restoring). <a href="http://www.crashplan.com">CrashPlan</a> worked!</p>
