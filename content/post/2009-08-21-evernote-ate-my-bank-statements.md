<p>I am reducing the paper in my hose to a bare minimum. Everything is scanned (old Canon flatbed scanner) and put into <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>. Insurance policies, items with emotional value, documents related to the house and some stuff that I may need for taxes go into a filing cabinet, the rest goes into a $10 shredder.</p>
<p>Since Evernote makes PDF's searchable, I can now search all my gigabytes of documents for any text. Want to look up a payment from an old bank statement? Evernote has it. Tax records from 2007? Evernote has it. Drawing my daughter made me for my bithday? Evernote has it. <br />&nbsp;<br />Less paper. More information. I love it.</p>
